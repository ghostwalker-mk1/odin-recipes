            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin_pie">Pumpkin Pie</a> is a dessert pie with a spiced, pumpkin-based custard filling. The pumpkin and pumpkin pie are both a symbol of harvest time, and pumpkin pie is generally eaten during the fall and early winter. In the United States and Canada it is usually prepared for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and other occasions when pumpkin is in season.</p>
            <p>The pie's filling ranges in color from orange to brown and is baked in a single pie shell, usually without a top crust. The pie is generally flavored with a spice mixture known as pumpkin pie spice, which is made using spices such as ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice. The pie is usually prepared with canned pumpkin, but fresh-cooked pumpkin can be used.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (9-inch) Homemade Pie Crust or deep-dish frozen pie crust shell (thawed)</li>
                <li>1 (15-oz) can pure pumpkin (about 1¾ cups)</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>3 large eggs yolks</li>
                <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup light brown sugar, packed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1¼ cups evaporated milk (you'll need one 12-oz can but you won't use all of it)</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.</li>
                <li>Prepare crust:</li>
                    <p><strong>If using a homemade crust:</strong> Remove the chilled pie crust from the refrigerator and place it on a baking sheet (this makes it easy to move in and out of the oven). Cover the crust with a piece of parchment paper. Fill the crust about three-quarters full with dried beans or pie weights. Bake for 20 minutes. Take the crust out of the oven; remove the parchment paper and beans/pie weights and tent the edges with a few strips of foil folded in half lengthwise (this will protect the edges from getting too dark). Bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is dry and lightly golden. Don't worry if the bottom puffs up; just press it down gently with a flat spatula, such as a pancake turner, taking care not to puncture it. Remove the foil but don't throw it away; you may need it again.</p>
                    <p><strong>If using a frozen crust:</strong> Follow the instructions for blind-baking on the package.</p>
                <li>After blind-baking the crust, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F.</li>
                <li>Make the Pumpkin Pie Filling: In a large bowl, combine the pumpkin, egg, egg yolks, granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, and evaporated milk. Whisk until smooth, then pour the filling into the pre-baked crust.</li>
                <li>Bake the pie for 50 to 60 minutes, until the filling is just set. It should look dry around the edges, but the center should jiggle just slightly if you nudge the pan. Keep a close eye on the pie as it bakes; if ever the crust looks like it's browning too quickly, tent the edges again with the foil strips. Let the pie cool on a rack (leave it on the baking sheet) to room temperature, a few hours. Slice or refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
